to log in, cd to the project folder (/twt_project) and type 'python manage.py runserver'. then, go to localhost:8000. I'm pretty sure you need django installed, but I'm not sure.

Since I didn't have the time to implement a full posting feature, I only managed to add the login/register component. I spent like 3 whole days on this because I didn't know anything about JS, HTML/CSS, Django, or Python, and I decided to learn from scratch. Given the time, I could probably implement a way to store posts in the same way that I stored users. I'm so sorry, this is really scuffed lol.
